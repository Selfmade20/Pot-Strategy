## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Pot-Strategy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Set up database**
   Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE links (
     id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
     short_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     clicks INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     last_clicked_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
   );

   ALTER TABLE links ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own links" ON links
     FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own links" ON links
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own links" ON links
     FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Production Deployment

### For Production, update the base URL:

1. **Add environment variable** in your production environment:
   ```
   VITE_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Or update the config** in `src/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   baseUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com'
   ```

### Deployment Options:
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment (recommended)

## How It Works

1. **Create Link** - User enters a long URL and gets a short code
2. **Share Link** - User copies the short link (e.g., `yourdomain.com/abc123`)
3. **Click Tracking** - When someone visits the short link, it redirects and tracks the click
4. **Analytics** - Dashboard shows real-time click analytics and trends

## Deployment Notes

- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized application ready for easy deployment
- **Dashboard Functionality**: All dashboard features work perfectly including link creation and analytics
- **Direct Link Access**: Short links work when accessed from the dashboard. For direct URL access, the Docker setup handles SPA routing properly.
